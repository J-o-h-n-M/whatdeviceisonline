Use your Raspberry pi to monitor the devices that connect or disconnect to your LAN and send the information to a Telegram bot.

As a starting point I used this project : https://github.com/hotzenklotz/WhoIsHome/blob/master/whoIsHome.py And lots of code is still reused.

But modified it to use Telegram in stead of Slack. And also made it work with the Raspbian distribution I have and Python 2.7.13.

I am running it on: 
PRETTY_NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)"
NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="9"
VERSION="9 (stretch)"
ID=raspbian
ID_LIKE=debian


Python 2.7.13
